### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a current software engineer at Vanguard and graduate of the Computer & Information Technology  Master's Program at the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. From my program I've taken relevant course work in Software Engineering, Computer Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analytics, Discrete Math and Algorithms. 

I have advanced programming skills in Python, Java, C/C++, Assembly, SQL, HTML, and GIT/GITHUB

Before my current program  I graduated with a Bachelors in Philosophy from the University of Pennsylvania and worked as an administrative assistant in the departments of Critical Writing and Biology. Because of this I have strong logical, administrative, and writing skills.
